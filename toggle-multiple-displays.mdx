## Introduction

With this script, you can ensure that mode switching is only performed if certain conditions are met, streamlining your display management process.

Let's dive in and unlock the power of PowerShell for seamless multi-display control in Windows.

### Requirements

- Windows OS
- PowerShell (Installed by Default in Windows)


## The Script

Save as .ps1

{/* ```powershell
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class DisplayModeInfo
\{
    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    public static extern int GetSystemMetrics(int nIndex);
\}
"@

$SM_CMONITORS = 80
$displaySettings = [DisplayModeInfo]::GetSystemMetrics($SM_CMONITORS)
$displayMode = ""
$displayNumber = $displaySettings

if ($displayNumber -eq 1) \{
    $displayMode = "Dublicated Display"
    DisplaySwitch.exe /extend
\}
elseif ($displayNumber -eq 2) \{
    $displayMode = "Extended Displays"
    DisplaySwitch.exe /clone
\}
else \{
    $displayMode = "Unknown"
    Write-Host "Current Display Mode: $displayMode ($displayNumber)"
    Pause
\}

``` */}


## How does it work?

The script functions by checking the current **Multiple displays** settings in Windows. You can easily find this information yourself in the display settings of Windows.

If you're unsure about the display you're currently using, I recommend running the script while swapping the numbers around as follows:

{/* ```powershell
Write-Host $displayNumber
Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to continue..."
```
 */}
This way, you can determine the display you want to work with. Inside the script, you can execute any desired actions. In my case, I use `DisplaySwitch.exe /COMMAND_HERE` to switch between extending and duplicating the display, but feel free to customize it to your liking.

It's important to note that the DisplaySwitch.exe utility, provided by Windows, enables you to toggle between various display modes by specifying the desired command after DisplaySwitch.exe.

By default, the script employs `/extend` for a single display and `/clone` for dual displays. However, you have the flexibility to modify these commands based on your preferences.


## DisplaySwitch.exe

DisplaySwitch is a utility provided by Windows that enables users to switch between different display modes. 

It allows you to control primary display settings, mirror displays, extend desktops across multiple screens, or switch to an external display.

It provides flexibility in managing and customizing display configurations based on your preferences.

### All DisplaySwitch.exe Commands

1. **/internal**: This command switches to using the primary display only. All other connected displays will be disabled.

2. **/clone**: By using this command, the primary display will be mirrored on a second screen.

3. **/extend**: This command expands the Desktop to a secondary display, allowing one desktop to span multiple displays. This is the default option.

4. **/external**: Switching to the external display only (second screen) can be achieved with this command. The current main display will be disabled.
