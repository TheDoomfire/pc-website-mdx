## Introduction

Our Git Repository Synchronization Script simplifies the process of updating multiple repositories hosted on GitHub. 

Designed to streamline maintenance and collaboration, this script automatically fetches the latest changes and performs a hard reset to the 'origin/main' branch. 

Whether you prefer Batch or PowerShell, we've got you covered with two versions of the script. 

Keep your repositories effortlessly up to date and in sync with just a few commands.


### Requirements

- Windows OS
- Git

If you don't have Git installed on your system, give our [App Installer](/tools/installer) a try.


## Batch Version

Save as .bat or .cmd

```
set "root=%~dp0GitHub"

for /d %%a in ("%root%\*") do (
  cd /d "%%a"
  git fetch --all
  git reset --hard origin/main
)

```

## Powershell Version

Save as .ps1


```
$root = Join-Path -Path $PSScriptRoot -ChildPath "GitHub"

Get-ChildItem -Path $root -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    Set-Location -Path $_.FullName
    git fetch --all
    git reset --hard origin/main
}
```

## How does it work?

The Git Repository Synchronization Script simplifies the updating process for multiple repositories. 

When executed from a folder, the script automatically searches for a subfolder named "GitHub" within that directory. 

It then proceeds to update each repository found within the "GitHub" folder. 

By leveraging this structure, you can conveniently organize your repositories and ensure that all of them receive the latest changes with ease. 

Whether you choose the Batch or PowerShell version, the script provides a seamless solution for keeping your GitHub repositories up to date.
